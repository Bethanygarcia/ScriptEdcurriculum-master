        <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
        <p>My name is Bethany Garcia. I will be attending DePauw Univeristy Class of 2023. Go Tigers!
        I am a Bushwick based artist, film photographer, and theatre actress.</p>
    
       <h2>What's the mission?</h2>
        <p> As an artist, we all see the world through a different set of lenses.
           My lenses see unlikely objects as canvases. Over the years, I've made unconventional canvases my specialty.
           That's not all folks, because experimentation is key. Remember Bob Ross' quote ,"We don't make mistakes. We make happy little accidents." Not only does it apply to children, it applies more so to art.</p>
        <h2>Just a bit more about me!</h2>
        <p>My favorite color is TARDIS Blue. My favorite food is anything from Action Burger. I love animals such as dogs, cats, birds, snakes, tarantulas, lizards, etc. I have been featured in two art galleries. I also do printmaking and film photography. </p>
